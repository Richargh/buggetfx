= BuggetFx

Bugget on your Desktop.

== Getting Started

Run the application with `./gradlew run`.

=== Build & Test

Build and test with `./gradlew build`.

== Reverse Engineering YNAB

First it helps if you have used YNAB for a couple of years. Then you have a lot of data to make assumptions.

=== Entity Types

This is how I found all entity types:

* `cd <your ynab folder>`
* `grep -rhro '"entityType": ".*"' . | sort | uniq -c | sort -bgr`
